# Lessons Learned — ai-demo-stack-baremetal

Two sections: **(A)** patterns carried over verbatim from the AWS build
(`sankat447/ai-demo-stack-aws` → `docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`) that still bite on
bare metal, and **(B)** new lessons surfaced during *this* build. Append to (B)
the moment something new bites — that discipline is why the AWS second install
went smoothly.

---

## A. Carried over from AWS (still apply)

> Numbering keeps the original AWS IDs so cross-references line up.

**#4 — Service Mesh STRICT mTLS + NetworkPolicy needs `maistra.io/expose-route`.**
Any deployment in a mesh-member namespace whose Route must be reachable from the
OCP router MUST carry `maistra.io/expose-route: "true"` on the **pod template**.
Without it the TLS handshake completes but routing silently times out. (Platform-
independent — applies identically here.)

**#7 — StorageClass parameters are immutable.** Changing parameters (on bare
metal: Ceph `monitors`, `pool`, `fsName`, etc.) requires
`oc delete storageclass X && oc apply`, not `oc apply` alone.

**#9 — PVC zombies survive a storage rebuild.** If you wipe the storage backend
(here: re-provision ODF/Ceph), PVs referencing old volume handles linger as
`Bound` and pods hang in `ContainerCreating`. Delete the PVC/PV and remove the
finalizer to free them. Especially relevant because **this whole project is a
storage-backend rebuild** (local-nvme → ODF).

**#10 — CloudBeaver self-locks after 1 h** if the admin setup wizard wasn't
completed. `oc rollout restart deploy/cloudbeaver` unlocks it.

**#11 — Several apps are API-only / have no UI** — don't report them as broken
in team docs: `portkey` (gateway; dashboard is a separate product),
`langchain-server`/LangGraph (use `/docs` Swagger), `prometheus-k8s` &
`alertmanager-main` (UIs moved to OCP Console → Observe), `istio-ingressgateway`
(mesh-internal; `503` on `/` is normal).

**#12 — `serviceAccountName` requires the SA object + SCC binding.** Any
Deployment with `serviceAccountName: foo` must also ship `kind: ServiceAccount`.
If the pod runs as a fixed non-default UID (e.g. n8n as 1000), add a RoleBinding
to `system:openshift:scc:anyuid`.

**#15 — Targeted teardown must include all dependents.** (If we ever script
teardown.) Anything that interpolates X's outputs must be torn down with X, or
it blocks the chain. On bare metal this maps to ArgoCD App-of-Apps ordering and
finalizers rather than terraform `-target`.

> AWS-only lessons #1,#2,#3,#5,#6,#8,#13,#14 do **not** apply (VPC/IAM/RDS/
> openshift-install-destroy specifics). The #3 (use `awk` not BSD `sed` for
> multi-line injection) and #8/#14 (`grep -E`) hygiene tips are still good
> practice generally.

## B. New — bare-metal build (append as they surface)

**#16 — These are VxRail appliances, not plain PowerEdge.** 3× VxRail E560F.
Going bare-metal means abandoning VxRail Manager + vSAN; the data SSDs must be
wiped for ODF, and there's no VxRail support story afterward. (docs/HARDWARE_INVENTORY.md)

**#17 — No GPUs.** RHOAI/KServe/vLLM/llama-inference run **CPU-only** on Xeon
Gold 6242R. Size model serving to small quantized models or add a GPU node;
this diverges from the GPU assumptions in the AWS stack.

**#18 — Match disks by MODEL, never `sdX`.** Device letters differ across the
three nodes already (boot drive is `sdb` on node1, `sdc` on node2, `sda` on
node3). `rootDeviceHints.model: "DELLBOSS VD"` is uniform and stable; ODF device
selection must likewise use model/WWN/by-path. (docs/HARDWARE_INVENTORY.md)

**#19 — Bond is active-backup, not LACP.** The two 10G ports go to a switch pair
(SW1/SW2) that is **not** presented as one MLAG peer, so the host bond is
`mode: active-backup`. agent-config models bond0 accordingly; OVN's `br-ex` is
auto-created on top — do not hand-define br-ex.

**#20 — VIPs are platform-managed, not MetalLB.** The bare-metal platform runs
keepalived/haproxy on-node for the api + ingress VIPs
(`loadBalancer.type: OpenShiftManagedDefault`). MetalLB is only needed for
*extra* `LoadBalancer` services and must use a non-overlapping pool in
192.168.102.0/24. Don't double-assign the VIPs.

**#21 — Internally-built images die with the cluster.** `sunbird-mcp-server`
was an OpenShift `Binary + Docker` build — the build context (Dockerfile,
real `package.json`) is stored **nowhere** in the cluster. Before any wipe,
capture the running image's artifacts: pull `dist/` + `package-lock.json` from
the pod, and reconstruct the Dockerfile from `oc get istag … -o jsonpath`
`.image.dockerImageMetadata.Config` (gives User/WorkDir/Cmd/Env/Ports). See
migration/README.md.

**#22 — Files written by the image build can be mode 0600.** `package.json` in
the sunbird pod was `-rw-------` owned by `nodejs`; under OpenShift's arbitrary
UID our `oc exec`/`oc cp` couldn't read it, and `oc debug --as-root` was blocked
by SCC. Workaround: reconstruct from the world-readable `package-lock.json` +
image metadata. World-readable files (`package-lock.json`, `dist/`) copy fine.

**#23 — `n8n export:workflow` does NOT export credentials.** Credentials are
stored separately and encrypted; exported workflows import but show "credential
not found" until you recreate the credentials on the fresh n8n. Export workflows
**and** plan a credential re-entry pass. n8n here is Postgres-backed
(`iis-ai-postgres-primary.iis-ai-data`); the CLI export works regardless of backend.

**#24 — Boot mode must be UEFI.** RHCOS on these E560F nodes installs only under
UEFI; set the one-time virtual-CD boot in UEFI mode and **eject the media after
install** so reboots don't loop back into the installer. (install/boot-instructions.md)

**#25 — zsh does NOT word-split unquoted variables.** `for p in $LIST` (where
`$LIST` is newline-separated command output) iterates **once** over the whole
string in zsh — unlike bash. Bit us fetching the AWS gitops tree. Use
`while IFS= read -r p; do … done <<< "$LIST"` or pipe into the loop. (Generalizes
the AWS shell-hygiene lessons #3/#8 to the default macOS shell.)

**#27 — "SSO console login" needs building — the AWS stack didn't actually have it.**
The AWS repo's OCP console login was **HTPasswd** (`admin`/`developer` in
`modules/ocp-ipi/main.tf`); its `reauth.sh` is AWS-CLI SSO and the OIDC bits are
for IRSA, not the console. Keycloak there was an *app*, never wired to OAuth. To
get real SSO we wire OCP `OAuth` → an OpenID identity provider pointing at the
in-stack Keycloak (`postinstall/04-identity.sh`). Two gotchas: (a) **always keep
an htpasswd break-glass admin** as a second identityProvider — a Keycloak outage
must not lock you out; (b) with **self-signed wildcard TLS**, the OAuth server
won't trust the Keycloak edge Route unless you give the OpenID provider a `ca`
configMap holding the ingress CA (`openshift-config-managed/default-ingress-cert`),
or login fails on a TLS error.
> **Decision (this build):** keep **kubeadmin** as admin now and wire **org
> Active Directory (LDAP)** later (`postinstall/04-identity.sh` +
> `active-directory-idp.yaml.tpl`); Keycloak OIDC kept as an optional fallback
> (`postinstall/optional-keycloak-sso.sh`). AD on OCP keys off `sAMAccountName`
> and needs a read-only bind account, an `ldaps://…:636` URL, and the enterprise
> CA in a `ldap-ca` ConfigMap.

**#32 — LocalVolumeSet won't claim disks that already have a filesystem.** On a
re-used cluster, the data SSDs still had XFS from the prior cluster, so the Local
Storage Operator skipped them (`totalProvisionedDeviceCount: 0`) — it won't
destroy data on its own. Wipe the DATA disks first (match by model, never the
BOSS/IDSDM): `wipefs -a /dev/sdX && sgdisk --zap-all /dev/sdX` via
`oc debug node/<n> -- chroot /host …`. PVs appear within ~30 s of a clean disk.

**#31 — `odf-operator` is a META-operator; the StorageCluster CRD lags its CSV.**
`wait_csv odf-operator` returning Succeeded does NOT mean the StorageCluster CRD
exists — `odf-operator` installs `ocs-operator` (which owns
`storageclusters.ocs.openshift.io`) a bit later. Applying the StorageCluster too
early fails with `no matches for kind "StorageCluster" in version
"ocs.openshift.io/v1"`. Wait for the CRD (`oc get crd
storageclusters.ocs.openshift.io`) before applying. (Fixed in postinstall/01-storage.sh.)

**#30 — `rootDeviceHints: model: "DELLBOSS VD"` silently hangs the install — match by attributes instead.**
Even though `lsblk` reports the BOSS model as exactly `DELLBOSS VD`, the agent
installer's disk inventory does NOT match that string. Result: `No disk found
matching root device hints` → `apply-host-config.service` loops every 32 s with a
409 "Requested installation disk is not part of the host's valid disks" → it
never goes `active` → `start-cluster-installation.service` (which `Requires` it)
never fires → cluster sits at `ready` and `wait-for bootstrap-complete` dies with
the misleading `failed to progress after all hosts available`. **Diagnose** via
`apply-host-config` container logs on the rendezvous node (`sudo podman logs
apply-host-config`). **Fix:** identify the BOSS by attributes — it's the only
**rotational** disk **≥200 GB** (data SSDs are non-rotational SAS 1.6 TB; IDSDM
is <100 GB): `rootDeviceHints: {rotational: true, minSizeGigabytes: 200}`. A live
install can be unblocked WITHOUT rebuild by editing
`/etc/assisted/hostconfig/<host>/root-device-hints.yaml` on the rendezvous node —
`apply-host-config` re-reads it on the next loop. (Refines #18: match by stable
attributes, but NOT `model` for the BOSS.)

**#29 — The agent ISO must be built on Linux — `nmstatectl` is required and macOS can't run it.**
`openshift-install agent create image` validates each host's `networkConfig`
(our bond0 NMState) with `nmstatectl`, which is Linux-only (no macOS build, no pip
binary). On a Mac with no container runtime the build dies with
`"nmstatectl": executable file not found`. Build on a Linux host (RHEL/Fedora:
`dnf install nmstate`) or in a Linux container (`podman machine` + a UBI9 image
with nmstate + openshift-install). Two related gotchas found the same run:
(a) **ocm release assets are dash-named** (`ocm-darwin-amd64`, not `ocm_..._...`);
(b) **the pull secret from `ocm` is pretty-printed** — compact it (`jq -c`) before
substituting into the single-quoted `pullSecret: '...'` scalar, or the multi-line
value spills `"auths"` to the top level and install-config fails to parse.

**#28 — "Prepare the hosts" needed no destructive prep — and pre-wiping would be wrong.**
Redfish assessment of the 3 E560F nodes (`install/idrac-boot.sh status`) showed
they're **already UEFI**, the data SSDs are on a **Dell HBA330 in JBOD pass-through
(no RAID/vSAN config to clear)**, and boot is the BOSS-S1 mirror. They run the
*old* OCP directly (not ESXi/vSAN — "VxRail" is just the chassis). So the clean
happens **during install**: the agent installer overwrites the BOSS root on boot,
ODF wipes the SSDs in postinstall. Wiping/powering-off *before* the ISO exists
just bricks the nodes (nothing to boot into). Correct order: build ISO → mount →
boot, and that single act overwrites the old cluster. iDRAC Redfish was reachable
and healthy on .5/.6/.7; `idrac-boot.sh boot` mounts+boots, `eject` cleans up
(clears media + boot override so reboots don't loop the installer — #24).

**#26 — Ported AWS manifests hide cloud endpoints in env vars, not just storage.**
The obvious translations (efs-sc→cephfs, gp3→ceph-rbd) are easy to grep; the ones
that bite are hardcoded service refs in `env:` — `*.ai-demo.svc` cross-namespace
URLs, an Aurora RDS hostname in a `POSTGRES_URI`, `s3://bucket` artifact roots,
`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`. When re-homing namespaces, every inter-service URL must be
rewired too or the handshake silently fails. Grep each ported file for `.svc`,
`amazonaws`, `s3://`, and the old namespace before trusting it.
